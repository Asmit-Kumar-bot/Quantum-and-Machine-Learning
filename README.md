# Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for Molecular Property Prediction

This project implements a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline using Qiskit to predict molecular properties.

## 📁 File
- `quantum_ml_molecular_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook combining VQE, quantum feature extraction, and QSVM-based classification.

## 🧪 Techniques Used
- **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: For quantum feature generation.
- **QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machine)**: For classification tasks.
- **Qiskit Machine Learning** & **Qiskit Nature**: Libraries used.

## 📊 Dataset
- Designed to work with datasets like **QM7** or **QM9** for molecular features.

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning
